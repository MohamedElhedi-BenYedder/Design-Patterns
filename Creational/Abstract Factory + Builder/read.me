Here are three common ways to combine the Abstract Factory and Builder patterns in Python:
 
 
    
    Abstract Factory with Builder Methods

This approach uses the Abstract Factory pattern to create a family of related objects, and the Builder pattern to create each object in the family. The Abstract Factory provides an interface for creating families of objects, while the Builder provides a way to create complex objects step-by-step.

In this approach, the concrete factories implement the Abstract Factory interface and have builder methods that create each object in the family. The builder methods can be called from the create methods of the concrete factories to construct each object in the family.

This approach works well when there is a limited number of objects in the family and when the objects are relatively simple to construct.

    Abstract Factory with Parameterized Builder

This approach also uses the Abstract Factory pattern to create a family of related objects, but it uses a Parameterized Builder to create each object in the family. The Parameterized Builder takes parameters that specify the characteristics of the object to be created.

In this approach, the concrete factories implement the Abstract Factory interface and call the Parameterized Builder with the appropriate parameters to construct each object in the family.

This approach works well when there are many objects in the family, and each object has many possible configurations. The Parameterized Builder makes it easy to specify the characteristics of each object, and the Abstract Factory provides a way to create a family of related objects.

    Abstract Factory of Builders

This approach uses the Abstract Factory pattern to create a family of related objects, but instead of using a single Builder to create each object in the family, it uses a separate Builder for each object.

In this approach, the concrete factories implement the Abstract Factory interface and create a separate Builder for each object in the family. The create methods of the concrete factories call the appropriate Builder to construct each object in the family.

This approach works well when there are many objects in the family, and each object is complex to construct. Using a separate Builder for each object makes it easier to manage the construction process, and the Abstract Factory provides a way to create a family of related objects.

To choose the most suitable approach, consider the complexity and number of objects in the family, the characteristics of each object, and the overall requirements of your application. Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages, and the best approach will depend on the specific needs of your project.
